So why don't you abandon them.  
Let yourself be free.  
This world is bigger than  
what we always believe in.  
So why don't you try to fade out  
from your dream of dreamed.  
Try to take the other risks.  
Your life should not be like this.  
Every color we can be.  
  

很有意思的一段歌词，来自My Little Airport的Josephine's Shop。

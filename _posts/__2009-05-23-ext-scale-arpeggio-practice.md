Scales and arpeggios must be practiced diligently.  
  
音阶和琶音必须坚持不懈地练习。  
  
Scales and arpeggios must be practiced HS; practicing them HT all the time will place them in the same category as Hanon.  
  
音阶和琶音必须分手练习，因为合手练习他们会让他们变为像哈农那样的不用动脑的重复练习。  
  
Two exceptions to this "no HT rule" are: (A) when you are using them for warm-ups (before recitals, etc.), and (B) when practicing to make sure that the two hands can be synchronized accurately.  
  
合手练习可在下面两种情况进行：  
A、热身  
B、练习两只手可以准确地同步
